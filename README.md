About me, Ideas, and Other Spontaneous Stuff

I am an aspiring AI system expert, aficionado of mathematics, with a background in Electical Engineering, mostly just signal processing and communication systems. I think of intelligent behavior as the ultimate form of signal processing and seek to understand how it is developed. My goal is to get started with non-trivial projects that utilizes existing successful techniques.


One idea I had for a while is to build an AI system to do pure math. The scope of the project is yet to be determined. The questions I am currently asking myself include:

what is the definition of "doing math"?

What are the inputs and output of the system?

If my desired output is a valid proof of the Divergence the of Harmonic Series, what kind of training data do I need to provide?

What type of architecture can I use to build a system that can generalize and explore new concepts?

Will such a system eventually be able to solve an open problem such as the Riemann Hypothesis?

Will I become famous if I build an AI that solves the Riemann Hypothesis?


One thing I do recognize is that math has many different sub-fields that deal with very different postulates, objects, postulates. But I can start with something simple. After all, little kids started with basic arithmetics, right?


If you already have an ongoing project that might fit my interests, please let me know!! I'd love to participate in more knowledgeable groups and talk to others about cool ideas.
